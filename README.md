# WebAppInAzure
To deploy a commercial web application on Azure cloud


A web application is a software program that runs on a web server, usually accessed by users through a web browser. Web applications are popular because they can be used by anyone with an internet connection. Some examples of web applications include online shopping, online banking, and social networking.

An Azure web app is a cloud-based service that allows you to create and deploy web applications. Azure web apps are built on top of the Azure App Service, which provides a managed and scalable environment for web applications. You can choose from three different deployment types: Web Apps, Web Jobs, and API Apps.
Web Apps are designed for business applications that accept user input and store data in a database. They can be written in different programming languages (including Python, PHP, Node.js, Java, C#) and are accessed via a URL. Web Jobs are scripts or programs that run either periodically or at an event triggered by an HTTP request. API Apps provide a set of endpoints through which external clients can access your resources without needing to have an understanding of your underlying architecture.
